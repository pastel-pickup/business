# Retaining Longer User Attention on Sephora.com
Mai Tran

# Abstract
With COVID-19 pandemic significantly reducing foot traffic to Sephora physical stores, it is important to retain user attention longer on the website to generate more sales, increase brand loyalty, and generate more ad sales for partnering brands. Since 48% of products are facial products on the website, it is proposed Sephora to give longer advertisement time for top highly-rated online facial products and brands such as Dior, Fresh, Yves Saint Laurent, Givenchy, and Hourglass, and to integrate a face image capture product recommendation system to make the website more interactive, thus, increasing brand loyalty and sales. 

# Design
1. Data Research & Harvesting - researched into future trends of cosmetic e-commerce and online consumer behaviors. Collected over 9,000 rows of product data with over 10 features from Sephora.com via Kaggle for analysis. 

2. Data Cleaning & Feature Engineering - cleaned the data in Google Sheets and engineered features for easier later analysis and visualization in Tableau. 

3. Explonatory Data Analysis & Funnel Analysis - used Tableau to perform various visualizations for explanatory data analysis and funnel analysis. The funnel analysis was performed to determine the top highly-rated online facial brands and the top facial product provider brands. These brands should be priortized in advertisement.
