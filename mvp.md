Preliminary EDA was performed on a Sephora dataset. The graphs show the higher number of reviews, the higher the rating of a product, yet there is no correlation between product rating and price. "Value price" is price adjusted based on customers' ratings. 

# Next Steps:
1. Filter out "online only" products
2. Filter out facial products with 4 or higher ratings
3. List top 20 facial products with 4 or higher ratings for longer ad exposure time to attract and retain users' attention
